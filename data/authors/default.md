A software engineer who values learning and growing with people, teams, and technologies.

Presently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Curebase](https://www.curebase.com) where I am helping to build a decentralized clinical trial platform while scaling infrastructure with a focus on security, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance.

Previously I've worked with the _Digitization Program Office (DPO)_ at the [Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu) as a consulting Full Stack Engineer in collaboration with the _Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)_.
