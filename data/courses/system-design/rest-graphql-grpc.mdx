A good API design is always a crucial part of a system. But it is also important to pick the right API technology. So, in this tutorial, we will briefly discuss different API technologies such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.

## What's an API?

Before we even get into API technologies, let's first understand what is an API?

An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It's sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user establishing the content required from the consumer and the content required by the producer.

In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and complete the request.

## REST

A [REST API](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for _representational state transfer_ and it was first introduced by [Roy Fielding](https://roy.gbiv.com/) in the year 2000.

_In REST API, the fundamental unit is a resource._

### Concepts

Let's discuss some concepts of a RESTful API.

**Constraints**

In order for an API to be considered _RESTful_, it has to conform to these architectural constraints:

- **Uniform Interface**: There should be a uniform way of interacting with a given server.
- **Client-Server**: A client-server architecture managed through HTTP.
- **Stateless**: No client context shall be stored on the server between requests.
- **Cacheable**: Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client-side.
- **Layered system**: An application architecture needs to be composed of multiple layers.
- **Code on demand** (optional): Return executable code to support a part of your application.

**HTTP Verbs**

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as _HTTP verbs_. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them.

Below are some commonly used HTTP verbs:

- **GET**: Request a representation of the specified resource.
- **HEAD**: Response is identical to a `GET` request, but without the response body.
- **POST**: Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- **PUT**: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

**HTTP response codes**

[HTTP response status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

There are five classes defined by the standard:

- 1xx Informational responses.
- 2xx Successful responses.
- 3xx Redirection messages.
- 4xx Client error responses.
- 5xx Server error responses.

For example, HTTP 200 means that the request was successful.

### Advantages

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Flexible and potability.
- Caching support is great.
- Client and server decoupling.

### Disadvantages

- Over-fetching of data.
- Sometimes multiple round trips to the server are required.

### Use cases

REST APIs are pretty much the default standard for designing APIs. Overall REST APIs are quite flexible and can fit almost all scenarios. For example, customer-facing external APIs.

### Example

Here's an example usage of a REST API that operates on a _users_ resource.

| URI           | HTTP verb | Description         |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| /users        | GET       | Get all users       |
| /users/\{id\} | GET       | Get user by id      |
| /users        | POST      | Add a new user      |
| /users/\{id\} | PATCH     | Update a user by id |
| /users/\{id\} | DELETE    | Delete a user by id |

_There is so much more to learn when it comes to REST APIs, I will highly recommend looking into [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)._

## GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. It was made by Facebook and open-sourced in 2015.

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.

_In GraphQL, the fundamental unit is a query._

### Concepts

Let's briefly discuss some key concepts in GraphQL:

**Schema**

A GraphQL schema describes the functionality clients can utilize once they connect to the GraphQL server.

**Queries**

A query is a request made by the client. It can consist of fields and arguments for the query.

**Resolvers**

Resolver is a collection of functions that generate responses for a GraphQL query. In simple terms, a resolver acts as a GraphQL query handler.

### Advantages

- Eliminates over-fetching of data.
- Strongly defined schema.
- Code generation support.
- Payload optimization.

### Disadvantages

- Shifts complexity to server-side.
- Caching becomes hard.
- Versioning is ambiguous.
- N+1 problem.

### Use cases

GraphQL proves to be essential in the following scenarios:

- Reducing app bandwidth usage as we can query multiple resources needs to be queried.
- Rapid prototyping for complex systems.
- When our data model is graph-like.

### Example

Here's a GraphQL schema that defines a `User` type and a `Query` type.

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  city: String
  state: String
}
```

Using the above schema, the client can request the required fields easily without having to fetch the entire resource or guess what the API might return.

```graphql
{
  getUser {
    id
    name
    city
  }
}
```

This will give the following response to the client.

```json
{
  "getUser": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Karan",
    "city": "San Francisco"
  }
}
```

## gRPC

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a modern open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication.

### Concepts

Let's discuss some key concepts for gRPC.

**Protocol buffers**

Protocol buffers provide a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in a forward-compatible and backward-compatible way. It's like JSON, except it's smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings.

**Service definition**

Like many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types.

gRPC uses protocol buffers as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface and the structure of the payload messages.

### Advantages

- Lightweight and efficient.
- High performance.
- Built-in code generation.
- Bi-directional streaming.

### Disadvantages

- Relatively new as compared to other REST, GraphQL.
- Limited browser support.
- Steeper learning curve.
- Not human readable.

### Use cases

Below are some good use cases for gRPC:

- Real-time communication via bi-directional streaming.
- Efficient inter-service communication in microservices.
- Low latency and high throughput communication.
- Polyglot environments.

### Example

Here's a basic example of a gRPC service definition in a `*.proto` file.

```protobuf
service HelloService {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string greeting = 1;
}

message HelloResponse {
  string reply = 1;
}
```

Using this definition, we can easily code generate a lot of code for us in our language of choice.

## REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC

Now that we know how these API designing techniques work, let's compare them based on the following parameters:

- Will it cause tight coupling?
- How _chatty_ (distinct API calls to get needed information) are the APIs?
- What's the performance like?
- How complex is it to integrate?
- How well does caching work?
- Built-in tooling and code generation?
- What's API discoverability like?
- How easy is it to version APIs?

|         | Coupling | Chattiness | Performance | Complexity | Caching | Codegen | Discoverability | Versioning |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| REST    | Low      | High       | Good        | Medium     | Great   | Bad     | Good            | Easy       |
| GraphQL | Medium   | Low        | Good        | High       | Custom  | Good    | Good            | Custom     |
| gRPC    | High     | Medium     | Great       | Low        | Custom  | Great   | Bad             | Hard       |

So, which API technology is better? Well, the answer is none of them. There is no silver bullet as each of these technologies has their own advantages and disadvantages. Users only care about using our APIs in a consistent way, so make sure to focus on your domain and requirements when designing the system.
