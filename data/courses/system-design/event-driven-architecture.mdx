An event-driven architecture (EDA) uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services. Events are data points that represent state changes in a system. When a user makes an action, they trigger an event, which doesn’t specify what should happen and how the change should modify the system. It only notifies the system of a particular state change.

Event-driven architectures have three key components:

- **Event producers**: Publishes an event to the router.
- **Event routers**: Filters and pushes the events to consumers.
- **Event consumers**: Uses events to reflect changes in the system.

_Note: Dots in the diagram represents different events._

## Patterns

There are several ways to implement the event-driven architecture, and which method we use depends on the use case but here are some common examples:

_Note: Each of these methods is discussed separately._

- [Sagas](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/distributed-transactions#sagas)
- [Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/command-query-responsibility-segregation)
- [Event Sourcing](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/event-sourcing)
- [Publish-Subscribe](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/publish-subscribe)

## Advantages

Let’s discuss some advantages:

- Decoupled producers and consumers.
- Highly scalable and distributed.
- Easy to add new consumers.
- Improves agility.

## Challenges

Here are some challenges:

- Guaranteed delivery.
- Exactly once, in-order processing of events.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases where event-driven architectures are beneficial:

- Metadata and metrics.
- Server and security logs.
- Integrating heterogeneous systems.
- Fanout and parallel processing.

## Examples

Here are some widely used technologies for implementing event-driven architectures:

- [NATS](https://nats.io/)
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)
- [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
- [Google PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)
