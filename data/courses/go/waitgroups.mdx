As we learned earlier goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized.

The [`sync`](https://go.dev/pkg/sync/) package provides useful primitives.

So In this tutorial, we will learn about waitgroups

Basically, **WaitGroup** helps us wait for multiple goroutines to finish.

We can use the WaitGroup using the following functions:

- `Add(int)` function takes in an integer value which is essentially the number of goroutines that the waitgroup has to wait for. This function must be called before we execute a goroutine.
- `Done()` function is called within the goroutine to signal that the goroutine has successfully executed.
- `Wait()` function blocks the program until all the goroutines specified by `Add()` have invoked `Done()` from within.

Let's take an example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func work() {
	fmt.Println("working...")
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		work()
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
```

If we run this, we can see our program runs as expected

```bash
$ go run main.go
working...
```

We can also pass the weight group to the function directly.

```go
func work(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Println("working...")
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(1)

	go work(&wg)

	wg.Wait()
}
```

But is important to know that a WaitGroup must not be copied. And if it's explicitly passed into functions, it should be done _by pointer._ This is because it can affect our counter which will disrupt the logic of our program.

Let's also increase the number of goroutines and update our waitgroup `Add` function to wait for 4 goroutines.

```go
func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(4)

	go work(&wg)
	go work(&wg)
	go work(&wg)
	go work(&wg)

	wg.Wait()
}
```

And as expected, all our goroutines were executed.

```bash
$ go run main.go
working...
working...
working...
working...
```

This is it for this tutorial, I'll see you in the next one!
