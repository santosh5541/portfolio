In this tutorial, we will discuss how we work with functions in Go. So, let's start with a simple function declaration

### Simple declaration

```go
func myFunction() {}
```

And we can _call or execute_ it as follows

```go
...
myFunction()
...
```

Let's pass some parameters to it

```go
func main() {
	myFunction("Hello")
}

func myFunction(p1 string) {
	fmt.Printtln(p1)
}
```

```jsx
$ go run main.go
```

As we can see it prints our message

We can also do a short hand declaration if the consecutive parameters have the same type. For example,

```go
func myNextFunction(p1, p2 string) {}
```

### Returning the value

Now let's also return a value

```go
func main() {
	s := myFunction("Hello")
	fmt.Println(s)
}

func myFunction(p1 string) string {
	msg := fmt.Sprintf("%s function", p1)
	return msg
}
```

### Multiple returns

Why return 1 value at a time, when we can do more? Go also supports multiple returns!

```go
func main() {
	s, i := myFunction("Hello")
	fmt.Println(s, i)
}

func myFunction(p1 string) (string, int) {
	msg := fmt.Sprintf("%s function", p1)
	return msg, 10
}
```

### Named returns

Another cool feature is [named returns](https://go.dev/tour/basics/7), where return values can be named and treated as their own variables

```go
func myFunction(p1 string) (s string, i int) {
	s = fmt.Sprintf("%s function", p1)
	i = 10

	return
}
```

Notice how we added a `return` statement without any arguments, this is also known as _naked return_

I will say that, although this feature is interesting, please use it with care as this might reduce readability for larger functions

### Functions as values

Next, let's talk about functions as values, in Go functions are first class and we can use them as values. so let's cleanup our function and try it out!

```go
func myFunction() {
	fn := func() {
		fmt.Println("inside fn")
	}

	fn()
}
```

We can also simplify this by making `fn` an _anonymous function_

```go
func myFunction() {
	func() {
		fmt.Println("inside fn")
	}()
}
```

*Notice how we execute it using the parenth*es*is at the end*

### Closures

Why stop there? let's also return a function and hence create something called a closure. A simple definition can be that a closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body.

Closures are lexically scoped, which means functions can access the values in scope when defining the function.

```go
func myFunction() func(int) int {
	sum := 0

	return func(v int) int {
		sum += v

		return sum
	}
}
```

```go
...
add := myFunction()

add(5)
fmt.Println(add(10))
...
```

As we can see, we get a result of 15 as `sum` variable is _bound_ to the function. This is a very powerful concept and definitely, a must know

### Variadic Functions

Now let's look at variadic functions, which are functions that can take zero or multiple arguments using the `...` ellipses operator.

An example here would be of a function that can add a bunch of values

```go
func main() {
	sum := add(1, 2, 3, 5)
	fmt.Println(sum)
}

func add(values ...int) int {
	sum := 0

	for _, v := range values {
		sum += v
	}

	return sum
}
```

Pretty cool huh? Also, don't worry about the `range` keyword, we will discuss it later in the course.

Fun fact*: `fmt.Println` is a variadic function, that's how we were able to pass multiple values to it.*

### defer

Lastly, let's discuss the `defer` keyword, which lets us postpones the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

```go
func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("I am finished")
	fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
}
```

Can we use multiple defer functions? Absolutely, this brings us to what is known as _defer stack,_ let's take an example

```go
func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("I am finished")
	defer fmt.Prinlnt("Are you?")

	fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Doing some work...
Are you?
I am finished
```

As we can see, defer statements are stacked and executed in a _last in first out_ manner.

So, Defer is incredibly useful and is commonly used for doing cleanup or error handling.

Functions can also be used with generics but we will discuss them later in the course.

So this is it for functions in go, see you in the next video.
