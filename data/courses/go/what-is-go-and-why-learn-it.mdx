Before we start this course, let's talk about Go.

## What is Go?

Go (also known as _Golang_) is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 and open-sourced in 2009.

It focuses on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. It was designed to solve issues like compile times, dependency management, and tooling that Google was facing.

In a way, they wanted to combine the best parts of Python and C++ so that they can build reliable systems that can take advantage of multi-core processors.

Okay, this is great, but **_why learn it?_**

## Why should we learn it?

### 1. Easy to learn

Go quite easy to learn and has a supportive and active community.

And being a multipurpose language you can use it for things like backend development, cloud computing, and more recently data science.

### 2. Fast and Reliable

Which makes it highly suitable for distributed systems. Projects such as Kubernetes and Docker are written in Go.

### 3. Simple yet powerful

Go has just 25 keywords which makes it easy to read, write and maintain. The language itself is concise.

But don't be fooled by the simplicity, Go has several powerful features that we will later learn in the course.

### 4. Career opportunities

Go is growing fast and is being adopted by companies of any size. And with that new high-paying job opportunities.

I hope this made you excited about Go. Let's start this course.
