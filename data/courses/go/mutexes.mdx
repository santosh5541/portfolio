In this tutorial, we will learn about mutex.

### What is a mutex?

Mutex prevents other processes from entering a critical section of data while a process occupies it to prevent race conditions from happening.

### What's a critical section?

So a critical section can be a piece of code that must not be run by multiple threads at once because the code contains shared resources.

We can use Mutex using the following functions:

- `Lock()` function acquires or holds the lock
- `Unlock()` function releases the lock.
- `TryLock()` function tries to lock and reports whether it succeeded.

Let's take an example, we will create a `Counter` struct and add an `Update` method which will update the internal value.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

type Counter struct {
	value int
}

func (c *Counter) Update(n int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Printf("Adding %d to %d\n", n, c.value)
	c.value += n
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	c := Counter{}

	wg.Add(4)

	go c.Update(10, &wg)
	go c.Update(-5, &wg)
	go c.Update(25, &wg)
	go c.Update(19, &wg)

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println(c.value)
}
```

Let's run this and see what happens.

```bash
$ go run main.go
Adding -5 to 0
Adding 10 to 0
Adding 19 to 0
Adding 25 to 0
Result is 49
```

That doesn't look accurate, seems like our value is always zero but we somehow got the correct answer.

Well, this is because in our example multiple goroutines are updating the `value` variable. And as you must have guessed, this is not ideal.

This is the perfect use case for Mutex. So, let's start by using `sync.Mutex` and wrap our critical section in between `Lock()` and `Unlock()` functions.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

type Counter struct {
	m     sync.Mutex
	value int
}

func (c *Counter) Update(n int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	c.m.Lock()
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Printf("Adding %d to %d\n", n, c.value)
	c.value += n
	c.m.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	c := Counter{}

	wg.Add(4)

	go c.Update(10, &wg)
	go c.Update(-5, &wg)
	go c.Update(25, &wg)
	go c.Update(19, &wg)

	wg.Wait()
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Adding -5 to 0
Adding 19 to -5
Adding 25 to 14
Adding 10 to 39
Result is 49
```

Looks like we solved our issue and the output looks correct as well.

### The `sync` package

So far we've discussed `sync.WaitGroup` and `sync.Mutex` but there are lots of other features available in the `sync` package that can come in handy while writing concurrent code.

- `RWMutex` stands for Reader/Writer mutual exclusion and is essentially the same as `Mutex`, but it gives the lock to more than one reading process or just a writing process. It also provides us with more control over memory.
- `Pool` is a collection of temporary objects which can be accessed and saved by many goroutines simultaneously.
- `Once` is an object that performs an action only once.
- `Cond` implements a condition variable that indicates the goroutines which are waiting for an event or want to announce an event.

This is it for this tutorial, I'll see you in the next one!
